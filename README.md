# CS 412 Introduction to Machine Learning

With Professor Elena Zheleva <https://www.cs.uic.edu/~elena/>

_This course provides an introduction to machine learning, the study of systems that improve automatically based on data and past experience. The course will introduce common machine learning tasks, such as classification and clustering, and some of the successful machine learning techniques and broader paradigms that have been developed for these tasks. Topics include but are not limited to decision trees, nearest neighbors, linear models, support vector machines, neural networks, ensemble methods, k-means, and graphical models. The course is programming-intensive and an emphasis will be placed on tying machine learning techniques to specific real-world applications through hands-on experience._
