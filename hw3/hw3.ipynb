    "*According to the Academic Integrity Policy of this course, all work submitted for grading must be done individually.  While we encourage you to talk to your peers and learn from them, this interaction must be superficial with regards to all work submitted for grading.  This means you cannot work in teams, you cannot work side-by-side, you cannot submit someone elseâ€™s work (partial or complete) as your own. In particular, note that you are guilty of academic dishonesty if you extend or receive any kind of unauthorized assistance.  Absolutely no transfer of program code between students is permitted (paper or electronic), and you may not solicit code from family, friends, or online forums.  Other examples of academic dishonesty include emailing your program to another student, copying-pasting code from the internet, working in a group on a homework assignment, and allowing a tutor, TA, or another individual to write an answer for you.  Academic dishonesty is unacceptable, and penalties range from failure to expulsion from the university; cases are handled via the official student conduct process described at https://dos.uic.edu/conductforstudents.shtml.* \n",
    "\n",
    "This homework is an individual assignment for all graduate students. Undergraduate students are allowed to work in pairs and submit one homework assignment per pair. There will be no extra credit given to undergraduate students who choose to work alone. The pairs of students who choose to work together and submit one homework assignment together still need to abide by the Academic Integrity Policy and not share or receive help from others (except each other).\n",
    "\n",
    "There are two parts to this project. The first is on multiclass reductions (50%). The second is on linear models and gradient descent (50%). There are also opportunities for extra credit (up to 25%).\n",

    "``quizbowl.py``: Multiclass evaluation of the quiz bowl dataset (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "``predictions.txt``: This file is automatically generated as part of Part 3 (optional).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Files you might want to look at\n",
    "  \n",
    "``binary.py``: Our generic interface for binary classifiers (actually\n",
    "works for regression and other types of classification, too).\n",
    "\n",
    "``datasets.py``: Where a handful of test data sets are stored.\n",
    "\n",

    "undoubtedly be helpful to you, so take a look!\n",
    "\n",
    "``runClassifier.py``: A few wrappers for doing useful things with\n",
    "classifiers, like training them, generating learning curves, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "``mlGraphics.py``: A few useful plotting commands\n",
    "\n",
    "``data/*``: All of the datasets we'll use.\n",
    "\n",
    "### What to Submit\n",
    "\n",
    "You will hand in all of the python files listed above as a single zip file **hw3.zip** on Gradescope under *Homework 3*. In order for the autograder to run, make sure the zip file contains **all** the .py and .ipynb files, not a folder with these files. The programming part constitutes 60% of the grade for this homework. You also need to answer the questions denoted by **WU#** (and a kitten) in this notebook which are the other 40% of your homework grade. There are also up to 25% of extra credit questions denoted by **WU-EC1**, **WU-EC3**, and **WU-EC3**. When you are done, you should export **hw3.ipynb** with your answers as a PDF file **hw3WrittenPart.pdf**, upload the PDF file to Gradescope under *Homework 3 - Written Part*, and **tag each question** on Gradescope. Questions that are not tagged will not be graded.\n",
    "\n",
    "The simplest and recommended way to export your python notebook is to select File -> Print Preview (this appears on the notebook, right under the Jupyter logo), then use the browser to print as PDF (e.g., on Chrome this appears under File->Print...->Destination \"Save as PDF\"). Make sure you double check your final PDF to make sure it's not missing any pieces before submitting your final version!\n",
    "\n",
    "Your entire homework will be considered late if any of these parts are submitted late. \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Autograding\n",
    "\n",
    "Your code will be autograded for technical correctness. Please **do\n",
    "not** change the names of any provided functions or classes within the\n",
    "code, or you will wreak havoc on the autograder. We have provided two simple test cases that you can try your code on, see ``run_tests_sample.py``. As usual, you should create more test cases to make sure your code runs correctly."
